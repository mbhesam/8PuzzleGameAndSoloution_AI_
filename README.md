# 8PuzzleGameAndSoloution_AI_

## About The Project
With this code you can play 8-puzzle-game and have fun. 
Also this code will get start position of nodes in input.txt and will solve the game by AI soloutions then save phase of solving in outputIDA.txt. 

**AI souloutions:**

**1.IDAStar:**

Iterative deepening A* (IDA*) is a graph traversal and path search algorithm that can find the shortest path between a designated start node and any member of a set of goal nodes in a weighted graph

**2.RBFS:**

Breadth-First Search is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a graph or a tree. BFS in python can be implemented by using data structures like a dictionary and lists. Breadth-First Search in tree and graph is almost the same

## Getting Started
just do followings for playing 8-puzzle Game:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbhesam/8PuzzleGameAndSoloution_AI_.git
pip install easygui
pip install pygame
python3 game.py
```
just do followings for solving input.txt node positions:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbhesam/8PuzzleGameAndSoloution_AI_.git
pip install typing
pip install copy
pip install numpy
python3 main.py
```

## Usage 
Edit input.txt and run project (main.py) then check result in output.IDA.txt.
Run project (game.py) and play.

enjoy it :)
